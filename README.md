## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project implements and compares two classification approaches â€” Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€” on a custom dataset for binary classification (C1 and C2)

## âœ… Key Features:

- A 2-layer MLP using backpropagation with sigmoid activation and random weight initialization.

- Learning curve visualization and region boundary plotting for MLP.

- Performance evaluation using accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

- Linear SVM and soft-margin SVM (C=50) classification using Scikit-learn.

- Comparison of model performance and analysis using confusion matrices and decision boundaries.
